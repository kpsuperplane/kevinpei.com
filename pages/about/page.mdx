# My Work

I am currently a full-time Front End Engineer at **Meta** working on Facebook Marketplace.

Before that I did internships at the **Liquor Control Board of Ontario**, **Yahoo Inc**, and the **Royal Bank of Canada**.

I have a Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo, where I spent a significant portion of my time helping to organize [Hack the North](https://hackthenorth.com), Canada's biggest hackathon.

# My Life

## Outdoors
Being able to the explore the PNW wilderness is an absolute privilege so I try to get out at least once a week. You can see my completed hikes [here](https://www.alltrails.com/members/kevin-pei-2/completed).

In the winter you'll find me on the slopes skiing with friends and hunting for fresh snow. I'm excited to dip my toes into backcountry for the 2023-2024 season.
