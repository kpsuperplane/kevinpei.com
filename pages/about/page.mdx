# My Work

I am currently a full-time Front End Engineer at **Meta** working on Facebook Marketplace.

Before that I did internships at the **Liquor Control Board of Ontario**, **Yahoo Inc**, and the **Royal Bank of Canada**.

I have a Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo, where I spent a significant portion of my time helping to organize [Hack the North](https://hackthenorth.com), Canada's biggest hackathon.

# My Life

## Outdoors
Being able to the explore the PNW wilderness is an absolute privilege so I try to get out at least once a week. You can see my completed hikes [here](https://www.alltrails.com/members/kevin-pei-2/completed).

In the winter you'll find me on the slopes skiing with friends and hunting for fresh snow. I'm excited to dip my toes into backcountry for the 2023-2024 season.

## Indoors
I enjoy reading about cars, snowsports, and technology in my downtime and I follow the web development space fairly closely. I'm also passionate about smart home devices, where I've made several custom setups including a Philips Wiz Homebridge plugin that [got featured on Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/how-i-saved-money-on-homekit-smartbulbs-with-philips-wiz-and-a-raspberry-pi/).

When it comes to games I pretty much only play Valorant, a "5v5 character-based tactical shooter" that I treat as a Massive Multiplayer Online Horror Game (MMOHG) with me as the guy who jump scares everybody else. I greatly enjoy approaching (and occasionally breaking) things in unconventional ways and that certainly extends to my 500+ knife kills in this shooting game.
